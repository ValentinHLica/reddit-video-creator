Project Reddit Video Creator
The idea of the future of the project is full automation, only job that is required with be selection/editing images using an phone. 

User can swipe (like tinder app) in choosing posts (this just to make sure for quality and to feel safer) and comments selection will be fully automated. Next step user can edit quick the template (change text and image position).
